#Taco Truck API

Welcome to my Taco Truck API. This API was a small project to help familiarize myself with creating my very own API that uses NodeJS for the backend. Additionally, this project uses ExpressJS to help create a server, PostgreSQL for the database, `pg-promise` and `bluebird` to help manage the database connection.

This README will be used to help myself walk through what I have learned.
